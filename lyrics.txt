So bye bye, folks at RIPE 55
Be persuaded to upgrade or your network will die
IPv6 just makes me let out a sigh
But I s'pose we'd better give it a try
I s'pose we'd better give it a try

Now did you write an RFC
That dictated how we all should be?
Did we listen like we should that day?
Now were you back at RIPE 54 where we
Heard the same things months before
And the people knew they have to change their ways
And we knew that all the ISPs
Could be future-proof for centuries
But that was then not now
Spent too much time playing WoW
Oh there was a time we sat on IRC
Made jokes on how this day would be
Now there's no more use for TCP
The day the routers died

So we sing it
Bye bye, folks at RIPE 55
Be persuaded to upgrade or your network will die
IPv6 just makes me let out a sigh
But I s'pose we'd better give it a try
I s'pose we'd better give it a try
